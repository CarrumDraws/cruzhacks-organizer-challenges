# CruzHacks 2021 Backend Engineering Challenge

In this exercise, weâ€™re asking you to create a simple REST API that supports the application portal created in the front end challenge.  

**NOTE**: This year, we will be using Firebase to host and deploy our site and functions. We are asking all applicants to create and deploy their functions via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Challenge

Your task is to create a series of API endpoints that perform basic [CRUD (Create, Read, Update)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) operations for a simple application portal. The application database will consist of hacker documents, which stores hacker information. You are expected to create API endpoints that supports POST, PUT, and GET requests.

* POST will create a hacker document in your database
* PUT will update your hacker's data
* GET will retreieve that information and display it in your appliacation portal until it's been submitted. Information should not be able to be updated once submit has been pressed.

## Database Schema

Your database schema should follow the application portal's fields. Form validation should be done client side, but fields inside each hacker object should have their respective constraints. Please refer to this [schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPo9_31LTOIkPMnFt-n4zWBOg7HsOB-yEDPmuAKsM6I/edit) when creating your database.

As mentioned, our team will be using Firebase this year, so we ask that your database also be hosted on Firebase as well. For the application portal, we will be using the [Cloud Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

### Sample Responses

Your completed program should be fully functional and provide appropriate responses when tested with actual API requests.

For example, the following request:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:applicaton/json" http://[projectID].cloudfunctions.net/getHackerInfo -d '{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe:}'`

Will create a hacker document in your hacker database with John Doe's information inside that document. It might return JSON similar to:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Succesful post to database"
}

OR

{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Unable to add user to database"
}
```

Keep in mind this is an example for one endpoint, your completed program should have enough endpoints that allow for full CRUD functionality on the hacker object.
