# CruzHacks Organizer Technical Challenges

Thank you for putting forth your candidacy for the CruzHacks 2021 organizing team. We're excited by the possibility of working with you! Our team will go through applications after the April 19 deadline and let you know what to expect next.

## Purpose

If you applied for the Engineering or Design teams, you are required to fulfill an additional technical challenge. The purpose of these challenges is to assess your technical skills and give you a preview of the type of projects you might be working on as a part of our team.

There are a number of traits we look for in prospective engineers and designers. We don't expect all candidates to be experienced professionals - far from it. Qualities that make a successful organizer that supersede technical skills include empathy, teamwork, communication, and accountability.

These traits are difficult to discern from a technical challenge. Thus while high performance on coding challenges will help your application, other factors will be taken into account.

## Challenge Submissions

Engineering candidates can submit either of the coding challenges, or both. Design candidates are required to complete the design challenge. If you're a candidate for both teams, you must submit both challenges.

You must email **contact@cruzhacks.com** a link to the Github repo for your project by April 19 (11:59 PM). Included in the repo's README.md file should be simple instructions on how to run your project. The email's subject line should read **CruzHacks Challenge - Last, First**.
