# CruzHacks 2020 Design Challenge

Your design challenge will be to create a hero image for the CruzHacks 2020 website. Remember that this is just a challenge to exercise your creative skills, have fun with it!

> In web design, a hero image is a large web banner image, prominently placed 
> on a web page, generally in the front and center. The hero image is often 
> the first visual element a visitor encounters on the site; it presents an 
> overview of the site's most important content. 

Esentially, this is the first thing potential hackers/sponsors would see when visiting the CruzHacks website. 

## Requirements 
Here is an example of a hero we considered using for this year: [Hero Mockup](./Design-Challenge-Mockup.png)

Similarly, your hero should include:
 - Title: CruzHacks 2020
 - Subtitle: Create something that makes a difference
 - The CruzHacks logo (feel free to us any of the provided versions or recolor it if you wish) 
     - [White Logo SVG](./Design-Challenge-Mockup.png)
     - [Gradient Logo SVG](./Design-Challenge-Mockup.png)
     - [White Logo PNG](./Design-Challenge-Mockup.png)

 - Location, Date (TBD feel free to fill in this year's as a placeholder)
 - Some indication that applications open in December
 - Please use the dimensions 1152 x 700 for your design. 

We're looking for clean, eye catching designs that represent CruzHacks, technology, and innovation.

For this challenge, feel free to follow your own design style, choose your own color palette, fonts, background color, etc. If you wish to use the 2019 color palette you are free to do so (#719AEB, #EBA471, #9782EA, #EB7187).

We ask that you please do not copy designs already made for this year, and that you do not work from a template. Feel free to use outside graphics but please credit the source in your submission.

Lastly, if you have a portfolio or any supplemental work you wish to include in your application, please include it in your email.

Thanks, and have fun!
