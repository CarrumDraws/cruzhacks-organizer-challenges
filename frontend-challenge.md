# CruzHacks 2021 Frontend Engineering Challenge

Engineers work closely with our UX/UI designers to develop user interfaces that delight and empower users. 


In this scenario, you're tasked with developing a dashboard that hackers can use to view announcements & register for the hackathon. The designers have conjured a mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/file/pxkqgNnVvLCZrvBP6no7Jr/Cruzhacks-Frontend-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1).
While a design mockup is given, you may take creative liberties as you see fit during this challenge. We don't need a pixel-perfect recreation of the mockup; rather, focus on delivering a seamless user experience! 


## Announcements 
Annoucements will be requested from a [RESTful API](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest) that retrieves data from a database. 


### API Schema And Endpoint

You'll be retrieving data via HTTP GET requests to this endpoint. The endpoint for the API is `https://[firebase URL]/api/`

**Sample Response**:

`GET https://[firebase URL]/api/retrieve`

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "datetime": "11/30/2019 08:16:28",
      "annoucement: "Check out our pre-hack workshops via Zoom!"
    },
    {
      "datetime": "11/19/2019 14:15:31",
      "annoucement: "Hacker application now open! Scroll below."
    },
  ]
}
```

## Application Form
The application form consists of three [conditionally-rendered](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) pages. Since we don't have a registration API available yet, [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub) the submit/save functionality. Focus on having strong form validation & functional pagination!

Refer to [this schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPo9_31LTOIkPMnFt-n4zWBOg7HsOB-yEDPmuAKsM6I/edit?usp=sharing) for user input constraints. Don't forget to notify the user if an input field fails validation!

## Design Considerations

### Responsiveness

### Accessibility

# [REWRITING]

## Technologies

You can use any technologies youâ€™re comfortable with for this project as long as dependencies are explicitly specified and setup is minimal. Our team will be using ReactJS.

The Github repo should include a readme with instructions on how to run your project.
